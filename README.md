## Project Background and Overview  
This project focuses on developing a RESTful API using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express.js. It was designed to follow best practices for API development, 
ensuring organized route management, comprehensive error handling, and secure authentication. With the integration of JWT authentication, the API ensures secure user access, 
and MongoDB is used for efficient data storage. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of building secure, well-structured APIs and handling database connections effectively.
